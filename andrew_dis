"Andrew Tate has finally been released from jail and is making a comeback! In this #shorts video, we've put together an edit showcasing his return to the spotlight, including some inspiring clips and footage of his past successes. We've also included the phrase 'Soldier of Allah' as a nod to Andrew's recent controversial comments. Plus, in the last 10 seconds of the video, we've added the English translation of Surah Anfal ayat 30, which reads: 'And [remember, O Muhammad], when the disbelievers plotted against you to restrain you or kill you or evict you [from Makkah]. But they plan, and Allah plans. And Allah is the best of planners.'
